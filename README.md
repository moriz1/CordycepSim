# CordycepSim
Born out of a Twitter conversation, I bring you: CordycepSim!

I was watching my Twitter feed one day, and a conversation somehow involving simulated snails and zombies, which then changed to zombie ants, to which I suggested a simulator about mutating cordyceps... and then I decided to actually build said simulator.
